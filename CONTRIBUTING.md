# Contributing to the Sunrise Bay Area Hub Website

Thanks for your interest in contributing. We are super excited for you to help us improve our hub website! The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Sunrise Bay Area Hub Website. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Communication

The fastest way to reach the Sunrise Bay Area website team is via [Slack](https://sunrisebayarea.slack.com/)
in the #hub-website channel. We use Slack for asynchronous communication, as well as coordinating
fortnightly status-update meetings.

If you're interested in learning more about Sunrise and haven't yet joined our Slack group,
please visit our [website](https://sfbay.sunrisemovement.org/) and fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQQ5mV2fJ8sIbhYNVm5XwnhAjymxllwMJ0EqIe3bkj-750ew/viewform) to get in touch!

## Collaboration Tools

We currently use Github both for hosting source code and project management. If you aren't already a member of our Github organization, you can request to join in the #hub-website Slack channel.

The hub website is managed through [this Github project][project].

## Workflow

If you'd like to work on or request a change to the hub website, first check to see if there is an [existing issue](https://github.com/sunrise-bay-area/sunrise-bay-area/issues) on the repo. If there isn't, feel free to create one or let us know in #hub-website so that we can create an issue for you. If the issue is time-sensitive, make sure to note the deadline on the issue, and ping us in #hub-website so that we are aware.

Before each fortnightly meeting, we will move the highest-priority issues into the to-do column of our [Github project][project]. If you'd like an issue to be prioritized, let us know in #hub-website so we can make sure that we address it.

If you're interested in working on an issue in the to-do column, give a heads up in the comments, assign yourself to the issue, and move the issue to the in-progress column. If the requirements for the issue are unclear, feel free to ask for further specifications in the comments, or in #hub-website.

Once the story is ready for review, move the issue to the "review in progress" column to request a reviewer. Any member of our Github organization can review PRs to the repo. Make sure that you link the GH issue from your PR.

Finally, once approved, you can move your PR to the "reviewer approved" column and merge to master. Changes to the repo will automatically be deployed to GH pages via Travis.

If you need assistance with any part of this process, please feel free to request help in #hub-website! We are super excited to have folks contribute to the website, and are happy to help you get started.

## Documentation

We strive to maintain clear documenation for both developers and other Sunrise members.

For developers, we maintain documentation on local development in this repo's [README](./README.md). When contributing new tooling,
please make sure to update the README so that other contributors can set up easily.

For other Sunrise members, we take notes of discussion topics and decisions at our fortnightly video meetings. Please join the #hub-website channel for access to the notes.

## Development Philosophies

Our development philosophies are a work in progress, that we hope to expand as our project progresses.

0. The websites we make should have the lowest possible complexity costs, including memory, time, and especially energy complexities. We hope for this project to be a sustainable effort, both for the planet and our contributors.
1. The websites we make should be highly maintainable by all audiences. They should be useable by the content contributors and software developers alike. We'd like for all interested people to be able to contribute to our hub's website.
