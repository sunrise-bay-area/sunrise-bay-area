  ## Who We Are


  Sunrise is a national movement to stop climate change and create millions of
  good jobs in the process. Sunrise Bay Area is one of the many local hubs that
  have sprung up nationwide to bring that movement to life!


  We're building an army of young people to make climate change an urgent
  priority across America, end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel
  executives on our politics, and elect leaders who stand up for the health and
  wellbeing of all people.

  ## What We Do


  ### And How You Can, Too!


  Weâ€™re making the climate crisis a decisive issue in the 2020 election by
  mobilizing millions, turning up the heat, and forcing the media to tell our
  story: our future is at stake, and we demand a real plan for addressing the
  climate crisis.


  As a local hub, Sunrise Bay Area is one of many in-person communities making
  this movement real. We organize strikes, pressure local politicians, make art,
  host trainings, throw parties, and more!
