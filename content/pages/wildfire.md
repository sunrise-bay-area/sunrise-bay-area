{{< text-block title="Overview" text="The goal of this campaign is to organize mutual aid and other forms of lasting support for communities most impacted by the fires, smoke, and extreme heat.

  <h2>What we do</h2>
  <p>We are providing support and resources to organizations already mobilizing mutual aid in response to fires (e.g. providing masks, air filters, water, etc) and working to identify/fill gaps that these other organizations aren’t already covering.
</p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to give people feeling grief, depression or helplessness about the climate crisis a concrete and community-oriented way to take action and feel empowered about supporting one another because THAT is the future we are building.
  </p>
  <p>
    We aim to shift the narrative from “Wildfire season sucks, California isn’t liveable anymore” to “This is a difficult and sobering new reality that Californians cannot ignore or abandon. We must prepare to help each other through fire season and extreme heat with radical community-based empathy and care, because our home and our community’s health and resilience is always worth fighting for.” We do not give up on the places and people we love.
